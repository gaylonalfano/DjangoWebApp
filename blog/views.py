'''
What if we wanted our pages to have images or posts by different authors, etc.? We want to display them in our templates. 
letâ€™s add some dummy data into our blog > views.py and see how to pass that to our templates. Ex. posts which is a 
list of dictionaries, each dict is a post
'''
posts = [
    {
        'author': 'CoreyMS', 
        'title': 'Blog Post 1',
        'content': 'First post content',
        'date_posted': 'August 27, 2018'
    },
    {
        'author': 'Jane Doe', 
        'title': 'Blog Post 2',
        'content': 'Second post content',
        'date_posted': 'August 28, 2018'
    }
]
# Now, let's pretend we made a database call and got back this list of posts. We want to display 
# this list of posts on our blog homeplage. We can pass these posts into our template just by passing
# an argument with our data. We'll put our data into a dictionary within home() view (see below). 
# Then, we can pass that context as our third argument to our render function. By doing this, it will
# pass that data into our template and let us access it from within the template. 
# So now whatever key name we use in this dictionary that we passed in (i.e., 'posts') will be accessible
# from within the template, and it will be equal to that value. So we will have access to the 'posts' key variable
# which will be equal to the posts list of dictionaries containing information of each post. 
# **Head to home.html template so we can see how to use it.

# Create your views here.
def home(request):
    """Handle traffic from homepage of blog. Return what we want the user to see"""
    context = {
        'posts': Post.objects.all()
    }
    #return HttpResponse('<h1>Blog Home</h1>')  # Better is to use a template
    return render(request, 'blog/home.html', context)

# Next, need to map URL pattern to this view function just yet. Need to create
# a new module in our blog directory called URLS.py. In that file, we'll map the
# urls we want to correspond to each view function.

# After the blog home route, let's add another route to our blog - the About page
# first in views.py, we write a function that will handle the logic for the about page.
# After we define the about(), we need to edit blog.urls module to setup the mapping to 
# the path of our views.py about() function.
def about(request):
    """Handle how we want to handle the logic of the about page"""
    #return HttpResponse('<h1>Blog About</h1>')
    # Can pass dict directly if not too large {'title': ...}
    return render(request, 'blog/about.html', {'title': 'About'})
