'''
What if we wanted our pages to have images or posts by different authors, etc.? We want to display them in our templates. 
letâ€™s add some dummy data into our blog > views.py and see how to pass that to our templates. Ex. posts which is a 
list of dictionaries, each dict is a post. 

After setting up a database to store data, you can update this views.py file to have context query the database
for all posts using: Post.objects.all(). Once you confirm that it's now pulling post data from the database,
you can delete (commented out) the dummy posts data (see below).
'''
# posts = [
#     {
#         'author': 'CoreyMS', 
#         'title': 'Blog Post 1',
#         'content': 'First post content',
#         'date_posted': 'August 27, 2018'
#     },
#     {
#         'author': 'Jane Doe', 
#         'title': 'Blog Post 2',
#         'content': 'Second post content',
#         'date_posted': 'August 28, 2018'
#     }
# ]
# Now, let's pretend we made a database call and got back this list of posts. We want to display 
# this list of posts on our blog homeplage. We can pass these posts into our template just by passing
# an argument with our data. We'll put our data into a dictionary within home() view (see below). 
# Then, we can pass that context as our third argument to our render function. By doing this, it will
# pass that data into our template and let us access it from within the template. 
# So now whatever key name we use in this dictionary that we passed in (i.e., 'posts') will be accessible
# from within the template, and it will be equal to that value. So we will have access to the 'posts' key variable
# which will be equal to the posts list of dictionaries containing information of each post. 
# **Head to home.html template so we can see how to use it.

# Create your views here.
def home(request):
    """Handle traffic from homepage of blog. Return what we want the user to see"""
    context = {
        'posts': Post.objects.all()
    }
    #return HttpResponse('<h1>Blog Home</h1>')  # Better is to use a template
    return render(request, 'blog/home.html', context)


# Section 10 - Creating a class since we're going to see the difference 
# between a class-based view (PostListView) and a function-based view (home):
class PostListView(ListView):
    # Need to create a variable called model. model will tell our ListView 
    # what model to query in order to create the list (all of our posts):
    model = Post
    # Changing which template we want this PostListView to look for:
    template_name = 'blog/home.html'  # Default is <app>/<model>_<viewtype>.html
    # Adding template_name won't work just yet because it doesn't know the variable name
    # in our template that we're going to be looping over (default is object_list but we used
    # 'posts' above in our home function view). Since we already have the template,
    # we'll set this variable/attribute here in this PostListView and that should do it:
    context_object_name = 'posts'
    # Adding an ordering attribute so have most recent posts up at the top of blog:
    ordering = ['-date_posted']

# Creating another class-based view that uses all the default naming conventions:
class PostDetailView(DetailView):
    model = Post

# Creating a Create view. It's a form where we create a new post, so let's add some fields:
# After we create this class/view, we need to update our url patterns with this new view.
# Need to inherit LoginRequiredMixin class to redirect users to login page if they try to view
# a create post detail page if not logged in. NOTE that you MUST inherit this on the FAR LEFT!:
class PostCreateView(LoginRequiredMixin, CreateView):
    model = Post
    fields = ['title', 'content']

    # overriding the form_valid() method:
    def form_valid(self, form):
        # Before submitting the form, take the instance and set the author equal to current user
        form.instance.author = self.request.user
        # After setting author to current user, return the form:
        return super().form_valid(form)

# Now creating an UpdateView
class PostUpdateView(LoginRequiredMixin, UpdateView):
    model = Post
    fields = ['title', 'content']

    # overriding the form_valid() method:
    def form_valid(self, form):
        # Before submitting the form, take the instance and set the author equal to current user
        form.instance.author = self.request.user
        # After setting author to current user, return the form:
        return super().form_valid(form)


# Next, need to map URL pattern to this view function just yet. Need to create
# a new module in our blog directory called URLS.py. In that file, we'll map the
# urls we want to correspond to each view function.

# After the blog home route, let's add another route to our blog - the About page
# first in views.py, we write a function that will handle the logic for the about page.
# After we define the about(), we need to edit blog.urls module to setup the mapping to 
# the path of our views.py about() function.
def about(request):
    """Handle how we want to handle the logic of the about page"""
    #return HttpResponse('<h1>Blog About</h1>')
    # Can pass dict directly if not too large {'title': ...}
    return render(request, 'blog/about.html', {'title': 'About'})
