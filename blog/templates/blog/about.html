<!-- After adding base.html and using block, we can delete everything that is shared with base.html
    Need to add extends "blog/base.html" and then write our for loop in a content block. **SEE BELOW** -->

{% extends "blog/base.html" %}
{% block content %}
    <h1>About Page</h1>
{% endblock content %}
