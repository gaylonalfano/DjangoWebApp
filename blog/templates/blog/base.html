<!--Want to include all the repeated code/sections between home and about templates, so we
    create a block in body section that child templates can override. So, basically the home 
    and about templates will inherit from base.html, but theyâ€™ll be able to replace/override 
    the content section with the stuff that is unique to each page.-->
